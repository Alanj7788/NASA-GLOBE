# Import the fibonacci function from the fibonacci module

# Input the number of terms in the Fibonacci sequence

# Get the Fibonacci sequence using the imported function

# Print the Fibonacci sequence
print(f"The first {n} terms of the Fibonacci sequence are:")

#OUTPUT
Enter the number of Fibonacci terms you want: 5
The first 5 terms of the Fibonacci sequence are:
[0, 1, 1, 2, 3]
