**AIM:**  
To perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus) based on user input.

**ALGORITHM:**  
1. Display a menu with operation choices.
2. Use a loop to continually prompt the user for their choice.
3. If the choice is between 1 and 5, ask for two numbers.
4. Perform the corresponding arithmetic operation based on the user's choice.
5. Print the result of the operation.
6. If the choice is 6, exit the loop.
7. If the input is invalid, display an error message.

**RESULT:**  
Implemented a simple calculator program that allows users to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus operations, and handle invalid inputs and division by zero.
