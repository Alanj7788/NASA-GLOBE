AIM:: To develop two Lex programs: one to count the number of lines, words, and characters from direct user input, and another to perform the same task using input from a file.

Algorithm:

1 a)
Start
    - Declaration of variables
    - Writing the rules for identifying the words, lines, characters, and incrementing the variables
    - Take the input from the user
    - Output the result

1 b)
Start
    - Declaration of variables
    - Take the input
    - Apply the rules for identifying words, lines, characters, and incrementing variables
    - Output the result

Result::
Successfully implemented the program to count number of words, lines and characters from user input and from file.
